------- INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS -------

For launch scenarios only, BEFORE installing Soyuz7k_T:

- In this order, Igel's Historical Spaceports 1.5, Soyuz 1.2 and O2016 improvements pack: https://www.orbithangar.com/showAddon.php?id=0bb66462-d9cc-4f68-95f3-482bc319a5c7

- DO NOT install Soyuz 1.3, third-party payloads are not working, pending update by author.

- Built for Orbiter 2016 exclusively, latest O2016 D3D9 build required for best visual and feature match. The built-in graphics engine is no longer supported. Vzor periscope will not work without D3D9.

- Sounds require XRSound. OrbiterSound is not supported, as XRSound will be included with future Orbiter releases.

- Non-launch scenarios have no further dependencies.

- Interior panels in Russian by default. To use the English virtual cockpit textures, copy and replace the textures from "Textures\Sirius_7k\Eng" to the main "Textures\Sirius_7k" folder.

- Please read the included Manual and Flight Guide for a summary and explanation of the currently implemented features and how to use them on a typical flight.

------- COMMON ISSUES -------

- If on launching a scenario no spacecraft are visible, install the x86 Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable packages for Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2022:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170

- Make sure to enable local light sources in the Orbiter settings
